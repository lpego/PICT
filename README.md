# PICT
A new an improved version of PICT ([Droissart *et al.*, 2021](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/2041-210X.13618)), based on Bookworm OS. 

For building and installation instructions see [Hardware](#hardware) and [Installation](#installation). 

For field checklist see [Field protocol](##field-protocol).

For more details on how to operate the PICT, see [How to](#how-to). 

# Field protocol
This is intended to be a quick list to check order of operations while in the field. 

## First setup
1. Position the camera looking at the object of interest
1. On your smartphone (or tablet), start the WiFi hotspot
1. Wait (up to 3 minutes!) for the Raspberry Pi(s) to connect to your hotspot
1. Find out the IP address of the Raspberry Pi you want to connect to
1. Open your browser and type `[your IP address]:8000`, hit <kbd>Enter</kbd>
1. This will open the live preview
    - adjust the physical position of the camera to get a good shot of your object
    - adjust the settings from the menus (i.e. resolution, focus, framerate)
1. Open your SSH app and connect to the Pi
1. Check the recording schedule: 
    - type `crontab -l`, hit <kbd>Enter</kbd>
    - if it needs changing, type `crontab -e` and use the special buttons on your SSH app to navigate the text and edit it; exit with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>X</kbd>, save file ("Save modified buffer? "<kbd>Y</kbd>) and overwrite ("File Name to Write: ..." <kbd>Enter</kbd>). 
1. Check the recording parameters for the camera: 
    - type `nano videos_v6.1.py`, hit <kbd>Enter</kbd>
    - With the special buttons in your SSH app, scroll down to the section "### Parameter declaration"; 
    - Check that the parameters are the same as your selected ones in the live preview
    - If not, edit them directly here (respect the correct formatting!) 
    - Exit with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>X</kbd>, save file ("Save modified buffer? "<kbd>Y</kbd>) and overwrite ("File Name to Write: ..." <kbd>Enter</kbd>).
1. Start the recording manually: type `./start_video_v6.1.sh`
1. Check that the recording has started: 
    - type `ls -lh record/videos`, hit <kbd>Enter</kbd>
    - look at the size of the most recent file at the bottom
    - Hit â¬† on your SSH app, this will bring up the last command (`ls -lh record/videos`), hit <kbd>Enter</kbd>
    - The file size should slowly grow over time if the camera is recording. 
1. Finally, disconnect from the Pi using your SSH app.

## Returning to the field
1. On your smartphone (or tablet), start the WiFi hotspot
1. Wait (up to 3 minutes!) for the Raspberry Pi(s) to connect to your hotspot
1. Find out the IP address of the Raspberry Pi you want to connect to
1. Open your SSH app and connect to the Pi
1. [OPTIONAL] Check the recordings has started: 
    - type `ls -lh record/videos`, hit <kbd>Enter</kbd>
    - take note of the last file name (useful to troubleshoot if recording has failed etc)
1. Stop the recording: type `sudo python killall`
1. Turn off the Pi: `sudo halt`
1. Disconnect from battery
1. Take out the SD card with the videos from the Pi
1. [OPTIONAL] move to another object / plant
1. Place a fresh SD card in
1. Replace battery with fresh one if necessary
1. Reconnect battery to Pi
1. Position camera
1. Check shot and settings from live preview
1. If no settings changes necessary, start recording; if changes necessary see above. 
1. Disconnect from Pi

# Hardware
In this guide I assume you are using a [Raspberry Pi Zero W](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-zero-w/) and a [Raspberry Pi Camera v3](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/camera-module-3/) (with IR filter, non-wide). 

For more detailed hardware specifications, take a look at ['How to build PICT' guide](https://zenodo.org/records/6301001), most of the recommendations still apply. 

# Installation
## Quickstart
The easiest way to get started is to use one of the pre-built images I provide.

You can download image ISOs here (requires permission): https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/136YHJ19of67geJv1VAqPn2JNwlM1lIbM

Use a software like [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/imager/imager_latest.exe) or [Balena Etcher](https://etcher.balena.io/) to flash one of these images to an SD card. 

> [!NOTE]
> If using [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/imager/imager_latest.exe), when prompted write the image without modifying the configuration. 

Once flashing is complete, insert the SD card in your Pi ad connect to power; you might have to wait for up to 10 minutes for the first boot to complete. 

> [!NOTE]
> The OS images provided should auto-expand to fill all available space on the SD card; is that doesn't happen for some reason, you can use the [`raspi-config`](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/configuration.html#expand-filesystem) utility to do that on the Pi directly. 

## Installing the OS
Alternatively, you can also start from a stock Raspberry Pi image and follow the steps below.

Using Raspberry Pi Imager v1.9.4 - https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/imager/imager_latest.exe 

Selecting these values in RPi Imager: 
 - Model: RPi Zero
 - OS version: Pi OS lite (32-bit) - no desktop, no dependencies

Selecting additional settings before flashing (input appropriate values for your WiFi network and region): 
 - Username: `pi` ; password: `raspberry`
 - WiFi SSID: `PICT_network_1` ; password: `pollinators1`
 - wireless LAN country: `CH`
 - locale: `EU/Zurich`
In "Services" tab: 
 - Enable SSH; use password authentication

# How to
## Connect to the Pi
In the following section I presume the configuration outlined above, that assumes you are using a laptop or a smartphone as hotspot with this parameters: 
 - WiFi SSID: `PICT_network_1`
 - password: `pollinators1`
 - band: `2.4GHz`

The Pi is already configured to look for this network and connect to it. 

How you can verify if the Pi is connected to your hotspot varies depending on your device, but the steps are generally something like: 
 - Windows: Wi-Fi settings > Mobile hotspot
 - Android: Settings > W-Fi & Internet > Hotspot & tethering > Wi-Fi hotspot
    - Alternatively, you can download [NetAnalyzer](https://techet.net/netanalyzer/) and use the "LAN scan" function

What you are after is the IP address assigned to your Pi, as you will need this for the next steps.

### Access live preview server
At boot, the Pi should automatically start a server showing the camera stream, which is useful to check framing and adjust parameters. 

To access the server, in any browser (both from laptop or smartphone) type in the IP address of your Pi, followed by port 8000. For example, in my case, I would need to type (the IP address will be different for you): 
```
192.168.137.71:8000
```

Press Enter and you should be presented with a screen like this: 
![live-server](assets/live-server.png)

There are a few preset values for resolution, autofocus and manual focus you can choose from; click apply and wait for the server to restart. 

## Connect via SSH
Currently, to modify configuration and manually start recording, you need to connect to the Pi via SSH. 

To do so, you will need to open a terminal: 
 - Windows: press "Start", type `cmd`, press enter
 - Android: download [JuiceSSH](https://juicessh.com/) or [Termius](https://termius.com/), open that app

Type `ssh pi@[yourIPaddress]`, for example in my case: 
``` bash
ssh pi@192.168.137.71
```
type password `raspberry` when prompted (unless you changed at configuration time). 

You should see a greeting message like this: 
![ssh](assets/ssh.png)

The basic steps to get to this point are the same across platforms, but on smartphone apps the interface might be somewhat different. 

## Record video
### crontab scheduling
To change when you want to start and stop the recording, you should use `crontab`. 

First, connect via SSH, then type: 
``` bash
crontab -e
```
and you should be presented with a text interface; scroll all the way to the bottom (on smartphone apps there often are special buttons for arrow keys), and you will see this snippet: 
``` bash
0 21 * * * sudo killall python
1 21 * * * sudo ifconfig wlan0 down
55 5 * * * sudo reboot
0 6 * * * /home/pi/start_video_v6.1.py
```

Brief explanation line by line: 
 - `0 21 * * * sudo killall python` means: at 21:00, stop all python processes (i.e. any recording in progress)
 - `1 21 * * * sudo ifconfig wlan0 down` means: at 21:01, switch off Wi-Fi
 - `55 5 * * * sudo reboot` means: at 5:55, reboot the system
 - `0 6 * * * /home/pi/start_video_v6.1.py` means: at 6:00, start recording using script `start_video_v6.1.sh`

If you want to change the recording times, simply modify the corresponding lines, respecting the format `mm HH * * * command` as shown above. 

When done, exit by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>X</kbd> (or equivalent buttons on smartphone apps). 

### Change recording parameters
For now, the only way to change recording parameters like resolution, focus mode, etc is to directly modify the Python script.

The scripts are located in the root of this repo, you should use the most recent one, in this case `videos_v6.1.py`. 

To open the file, type: 
``` bash
nano videos_v6.1.py
```

You will be presented with a text interface; navigate down using the arrow keys (or equivalent button on smartphone apps) and find this code block (starts at line 13): 
```python
### Parameters declaration
video_duration = 1800
video_number = 336
resolution = (1536, 864)  # Set the desired resolution as (width, height), WIDE format
target_fps = 10
focus = "Manual"  # Set to "Auto" or "Manual"
focus_distance = 4  # Only used if Focus is "Manual"; 0 (infinity) and 10.0 (approx. 10cm); default is 0.5 (focus at ~1m))
video_dir = "/home/pi/record/videos/"
os.makedirs(video_dir, exist_ok=True)
```

This is where you can modify the recording parameters; most variables are self-explanatory, but `video_duration` is expressed in seconds (e.g. 1800 second = 30 minutes); `video_number` is how many videos to record (e.g. 336 / 2 / 14 = 12 days of recording 14 hours per day, videos of 0.5 hours); `focus_distance` is expressed in dioptres, 1/focus_distance (e.g. 1/4 = 25 cm). 

Modify the desired parameters, then pres <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>X</kbd> (or equivalent buttons on smartphone apps), and confirm overwriting with the same name. 

### Start recording manually
If you want to start recording manually, you can do so by running the dedicated `.sh` scripts; use the one named the same as the python file you want to use, in this case `start_video_v6.1.sh`. 

You can run these files by typing: 
``` bash
./start_video_v6.1.sh
```

These scripts will stop the live server, if active, log the output of the python script and prevent another recording to automatically start. 
`crontab` scheduling will take place as instructed. 

### Autostart recording
There is a service running on the Pi that monitors user activity, and if none is detected (i.e. no connection to SSH, no open web browser with live preview server, not running commands), after 10 minutes of inactivity the recording will start using the latest shell script, in this case `start_video_v6.1.sh`. 

If there is already a recording in progress (e.g. it was started manually), a new one will not be triggered.
